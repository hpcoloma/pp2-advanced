## **Project Introduction**<a name="introduction"></a>
### PayCalcs IE
PayCalcs IE is an app designed to calculate net pay base on your total income, tax deductions, pension contribution and other personal circumstances. This will help you estimate your take-home pay taking into consideration tax regulations and allowances.

### Wireframes
I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) to generate digital sketches of how I want my site to look like on different devices. Balsamiq had helped me visualised my idea and finalised my design before I start writing my codes.

### Colour Scheme
I wanted a combination of earthy tones with vibrant pops of colors that creates a versatile and balanced palette. I searched for a logo that would match my project idea. Logo that has a calculator and euro sign. I found this [LOGO IMAGE](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/9720/9720608.png) on the web for my logo. I changed the dollar sign to euro sign. I also found this [BACKGORUND IMAGE](https://cdn.stackoverflow.co/images/jo7n4k8s/production/81cf622ff38560139839d5be23fff951bd33a243-1420x920.png?rect=0,87,1420,746&w=1200&h=630&auto=format&dpr=2) and instantly liked the color combination. So I created a palette from these photos by uploading them to [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com) to get the hex codes for some of the color shades on the photos.

I also checked the colour combination contrast on 
[Eightshapes Grid Contrast](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/)

### Fonts
I wanted a plain sans serif text that is easy to read both on big and small screens. Also, that looks like a calculator texts. Quicksand is a display sans serif with rounded terminals. Ir's rounded ;etterformds give a soft and approachable feel, making it suitable for user interfaces. Quicksand maintains good readability, making it easy for users to view and understand salary-related information. The font's versatility allows it to adapt top various design styles while maintaining a cotemporary look. Font was downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Imagery Used
I have very limited images used on this project. The logo was sourced from [Flaticon](https://flaticon.com) and the background was from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). 
These images were reduced using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com).
